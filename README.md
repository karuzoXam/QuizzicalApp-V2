# :game_die: QuizzApp
A quiz app that is a solo project from the Scrimba Frontend Career Path. Which requires the skills and technologies I have learned so far. The application uses the Open Trivia Database, from which the data is loaded. The app is not responsive as my main focus was on functionality.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Main Technologies
* `React`
  * useState
  * useEffect
* `Vite`
* `HTML`
  * HTML Entities
* `CSS`

## :dart: Requirements
-  Two screens(start & questions) :heavy_check_mark:
-  Pull 5 questions from the [OTDB API](https://opentdb.com/) :heavy_check_mark:
-  Tally correct answers after "Check answers" is clicked :heavy_check_mark:
-  Styled & polished :heavy_check_mark:

## :no_entry: Bugs and Issues
 Sometimes the data is not displayed correctly decoded, but in the code itself, it is correctly decoded.
